        <em><b>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</b></em> is an American movie based on a Hunter S. Thompson's novel. The movie was directed by Terry Gilliam and released in <b>1998</b>. The film pictures the story of journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) exploring the city of Las Vegas while living the American Dream and being under influence of different psychoactive substances. Both of them are hired by Sports Illustrated to cover the Mint 400 which is the richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune-buggies taking place in California’s deserts.
        They drive rented Chevrolet Impala through deserts with suitcase full of drugs. Their terrific  abuse of psychoactive substances makes them wonder between bars, clubs, hotels and different locations without paying for them and experiencing all stages of being high. After unsuccessful attempt to do their job at the desert race they continue this crazy drug binge. Later on they trash one of the hotel rooms after eating a hole sheet of blotter acid and mixing it with other substances, moreover they receive a massive room service bill and Gonzo flies back to LA leaving Duke on his own. Raoul attempts to leave Las Vegas but then he ends going back, meeting with Gonzo again and covering a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Back at the hotel Duke tries Gonzo’s stash of adenochrome and his full of hallucinating  trip gets out of control so Duke blacks out. Waking up to his room being a complete ruin Duke finds a tape recorder and tries to remember what has happened that night. He listens to all of the wild things they both did with Gonzo and even finds out he tried to buy an orangutan. At the end Duke gives Gonzo a ride to the airport, finishes his article and drives the same red Chevy back to LA.
